# Oblique Strategies

## Introduction

a set of abstruse prompts printed on a deck of cards, as a creativity aid. 

## Main Content

🧠 **What Are Oblique Strategies?**

Originally created in 1975 by musician Brian Eno and painter Peter Schmidt, **Oblique Strategies** are a deck of cards, each printed with a cryptic or paradoxical prompt (e.g., *“Repetition is a form of change”* or *“Use an old idea”*). They're designed to provoke non-linear thinking and help artists break through creative blocks—especially in high-pressure situations.

🔍**Creativity from AI or traditional tools:**

The Santa Clara University experiment compared how people generated ideas using either ChatGPT or Oblique Strategies. Despite aiming for originality, the group using AI produced **more homogenized** and **semantically similar** ideas. In contrast, the Oblique Strategies group maintained a broader range of originality and divergent thinking.

📉 **Why It Matters:**

This comparison underlines the article’s central concern: while AI may offer instant “acceptable-looking” outputs, it tends to steer users toward consensus and average ideas. Oblique Strategies, despite their abstruseness, push users into unexpected cognitive directions—preserving individuality and creative surprise.

## **How Can we Apply Oblique Strategies to My Work?**

🎭 **Oblique Strategies** can be your secret weapon for breaking out of technical routines or philosophical ruts—and in your case, Coriolanus, they might just electrify the way you code, critique, and create.

Here’s how you could meaningfully apply them to your work:

---

🧪 **1. Debugging Through Cognitive Disruption**

Instead of approaching Python or Rust errors linearly, pull a card like:

> “What wouldn't you do?” or “Use an old idea.”
> 
> 
> These can jolt you into trying legacy solutions, reversing assumptions, or revisiting past configurations with fresh eyes—especially when you're neck-deep in compiler quirks or cross-platform chaos.
> 

---

✍️ **2. Philosophical Reflection with a Twist**

When you're unpacking societal norms or cultural critiques, an abstract prompt like:

> “Cut a vital connection” or “Accept advice.”
> 
> 
> …can force you to confront blind spots or cultural assumptions you’ve internalized, leading to richer and more original analysis—like flipping a critique upside down and examining its inverse.
>

🎨 **3. Generative Creativity and Idea Synthesis**

In exploring the tension between intimacy and commodification, Oblique Strategies can act as thematic filters. A card like:

> “Emphasize differences” or “Honor thy error as a hidden intention”
> 
> 
> …might direct you to foreground contradictions, lean into ambiguity, or celebrate messiness—fertile ground for crafting resonant arguments or speculative explorations.
> 

---

🔄 **4. Technical Documentation & Writing**

Next time you're documenting a workflow or writing a README, try:

> “Don't stress one thing more than another”
> 
> 
> Use it to balance detail and tone, ensuring clarity without overengineering. Especially useful when writing for audiences across platforms or disciplines.
